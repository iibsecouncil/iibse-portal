      <h2>Rural Education at IIBSE</h2>
      <p>
        The IIBSE Rural Education Initiative is a dedicated effort to strengthen and support
        village, rural, and small schools, ensuring that quality education reaches every child,
        regardless of geography, infrastructure, or economic background.
      </p>
      <p>
        IIBSE believes that rural education is the foundation of national development.
        By empowering rural schools with flexible systems, skill-integrated learning,
        and value-based education, IIBSE works to create equal learning opportunities.
