    <h2>🏛️ About IIBSE Council</h2>
    <p>
      Indian International Board of Skills School & Education Council (IIBSE) is an autonomous
      examination and affiliation council established with the vision of creating a holistic,
      skill-integrated, and inclusive education system aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      IIBSE was founded to address the growing need for an education model that goes beyond
      textbooks and examinations — one that equally values academics, skills, ethics, culture,
      and real-world readiness, ensuring equal opportunities for students across urban, rural,
      and underserved communities.
    </p>

    <h2>👤 Founder</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Dr. N. K. Reddy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      IIBSE Council was founded by Dr. N. K. Reddy, a professionally qualified physician,
      educationist, entrepreneur, and social worker.
      He is the Founder of DKNRSF (NGO) and DKNR Kids School, and has been actively engaged
      in social service and educational development since the year 2000.
    </p>

    <p>
      With decades of grassroots experience in education, healthcare, and community service,
      Dr. Reddy envisioned an education system that is child-centric, skill-oriented,
      value-based, and accessible to all, especially for rural and small institutions.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Why IIBSE Council Was Established</h2>
    <p>
      The IIBSE Council was established to respond to key challenges in the existing education system:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Over-emphasis on rote learning</li>
      <li>Limited integration of skills with academics</li>
      <li>Inadequate support for rural and small schools</li>
      <li>Need for NEP-aligned, future-ready education</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      IIBSE aims to create a balanced education ecosystem where learning prepares students not
      only for examinations, but also for life, work, and responsible citizenship.
    </p>

    <h2>📘 Message for Education</h2>
    <p>

      real-world challenges.

      <li>Practical skills</li>
      <li>Ethical values</li>
      <li>Social responsibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      capable, confident, and compassionate individual.
