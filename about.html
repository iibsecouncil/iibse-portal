      <h2>🎯 Why IIBSE Council Was Established</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Over-emphasis on rote learning</li>
        <li>Limited integration of skills with academics</li>
        <li>Inadequate support for rural and small schools</li>
        <li>Need for NEP-aligned, future-ready education</li>
      </ul>

        IIBSE aims to create a balanced education ecosystem where learning prepares students
