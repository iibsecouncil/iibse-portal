    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The IIBSE Curriculum is designed to provide a balanced, holistic, and future-ready learning experience,
      integrating academic knowledge, practical skills, values, and life competencies.
      It is aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023,
      ensuring relevance, flexibility, and inclusivity for learners across India.
    </p>

    <p>
      IIBSE believes that education must prepare students not only for examinations,
      but for real life, careers, and responsible citizenship.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Curriculum Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The IIBSE curriculum is built on the following core principles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Learning with Purpose</strong> – Education connected to real-world application</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Integration</strong> – Academics blended with vocational and life skills</li>
      <li><strong>Child-Centric Approach</strong> – Respecting individual pace and potential</li>
      <li><strong>Values & Ethics</strong> – Culture, integrity, and social responsibility</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity & Accessibility</strong> – Equal opportunities for urban and rural learners</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach ensures students develop knowledge, skills, confidence, and character together.
    </p>

    <h2>🧒 Strong Focus on Foundational Education</h2>
    <p>
      IIBSE places special emphasis on Foundational and Early Childhood Education,
      recognizing it as the most critical stage of learning.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Play-based and activity-based learning</li>
      <li>Language and numeracy development</li>
      <li>Cultural awareness and moral values</li>
      <li>Early exposure to practical and life skills</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This foundation supports nursery, pre-primary, and early-grade schools,
      especially rural and small institutions, helping children build strong learning habits from the beginning.
